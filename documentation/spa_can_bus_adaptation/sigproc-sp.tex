% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org
%
% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1}
% I've updated the number of authers ~ Christoffer 2012-10-14

%  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

%        \email{email}
}
% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.
% \additionalauthors{Additional authors: John Smith (The Th{\o}rv{\"a}ld Group,
%email: {\texttt{jsmith@affiliation.org}}) and Julius P.~Kumquat
%(The Kumquat Consortium, email: {\texttt{jpkumquat@consortium.net}}).}

% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors
% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the

\input{appendixA.tex}
%Appendix A
%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%\subsection{Introduction}
%\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%\subsubsection{Math Equations}
%\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%\paragraph{Display Equations}
%\subsubsection{Citations}
%\subsubsection{Tables}
%\subsubsection{Figures}
%\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
%\subsection{Conclusions}
%\subsection{Acknowledgments}
%\subsection{Additional Authors}
%This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%You just add the names and information in the
%\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%of the document.
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%the .tex source file and comment out
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%\section{More Help for the Hardy}
%The acm\_proc\_article-sp document class file itself is chock-full of succinct
%and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%it useful but please remember not to change it.
